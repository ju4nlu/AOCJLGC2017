# AOC17JLGC
Solutions to Advent of Code 17!

Here I will be uploading the solutions (those that I achieve to complete) to [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/). I am going to use `Python` mainly, but I might change languages if I find it suitable. A more detailed explanation of some of the problems can be found [here (yep, it's my blog)](https://datasom.wordpress.com)

Files are always called `AOCXXJLGC`, being `XX` the challenge number.

Suggestions to improve are **more than welcome**!
